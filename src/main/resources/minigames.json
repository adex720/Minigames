    "description": "Hangman is a classic game originally played with paper and pencil. A word is chosen and the guessers get to know its length. The guessers proceed to guessing letters.

If the picture gets finished the game is lost. If the guesser thinks he/she knows the word he can also guess the word but if it's wrong a the picture is being continued on."
