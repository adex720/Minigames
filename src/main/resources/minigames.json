  "hangman": {
    "description": "Hangman is a classic game originally played with paper and pencil. A word is chosen and the guessers get to know its length. The guessers proceed to guessing letters. If the word contains at least one of the letter places of all of that letter are revealed. If the word does not contain the guessed letter a picture of hang is drawn to be closer to finished. If the picture gets finished the game is lost. If the guesser thinks he/she knows the word he can also guess the word but if it's wrong a the picture is being continued on.",
    "tips": "- Start by guessing the most common letters. (e, t, a, o, i, n)\n- Guess letters that you think would be in a word with the known letters.\n- Only guess as word when you are sure. You don't lose anything from guessing only letters.",
    "rules": "Each wrong guess reduces one life. You have 10 life per game.",
