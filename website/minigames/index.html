<div class="minigame-blackjack" id="blackjack">
    <h2>Counting</h2>
    <p>
        Blackjack is one of the most famous gambling games. The player and the dealer are both dealt two cards from
        start, but one of the dealer's stays hidden. The player draws more cards until the player decides to stop. After
        the player finished, the dealer draws cards. In the end, the one with larger total sum is the winner, but if
        either goes past 21, it's instantly a loose. Number cards are worth normal. Face cards are worth 10. Ace is
        worth 11 or 1 if the higher score would surpass the limit of 21. The dealer will stop drawing more cards when
        the sum of the cards is over 16. If your score is 21 after the first two cards, you win 1.5x your bet. If you
        haven't drawn any optional cards, you can double your bet, but then you must draw one card, and then give the
        turn to the dealer.

        all of that letter are revealed. If the word does not contain the guessed letter a picture of hang is drawn to
        be closer to finished. If the picture gets finished the game is lost. If the guesser thinks he/she knows the

        everyone tries to remember their positions. Then it's the next person's turn. When all pairs are found, the
        winner(s) are the player(s) who found the most pairs. There are eight different colorings and fill patterns,
        which results on 64 different combinations. The order of the cards on the board is fully random. Although good
